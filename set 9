1. Write a R program to create a factor corresponding to height of
women data set , whichinbuild in R, contains height and weights for a
sample of women.


data("women")

height_factor <- factor(women$height)
print(height_factor)

2. Write a R program to extract the five of the levels of factor
created from a random sample from the LETTERS (Part of the
base R distribution.


set.seed(123)
sample_letters <- sample(LETTERS, 20, replace = TRUE)
letter_factor <- factor(sample_letters)

five_levels <- levels(letter_factor)[1:5]
print(five_levels)

3. Write a R program to create an array of two 3x3 matrices each with
3 rows and 3 columns from two given two vectors. Print the second
row of the second matrix of the array and the element in the 3rd row
and 3rd column of the 1st matrix.



vector1 <- 1:9
vector2 <- 10:18

matrix1 <- matrix(vector1, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
matrix2 <- matrix(vector2, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)

array_data <- array(c(matrix1, matrix2), dim = c(3, 3, 2))

second_row_matrix2 <- array_data[2, , 2]
element_3rd_row_3rd_col_matrix1 <- array_data[3, 3, 1]

print(second_row_matrix2)
print(element_3rd_row_3rd_col_matrix1)



4. For this exercise, use the (built-in) dataset Titanic. a. Draw a Bar
chart to show details of “Survived” on the Titanic based on passenger
Class b. Modify the above plot based on gender of people who
survived c. Draw histogram plot to show distribution of feature “Age

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

data("Titanic")
titanic_data <- as.data.frame(Titanic)

ggplot(titanic_data, aes(x = Class, fill = Survived)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Survival on the Titanic by Class", x = "Passenger Class", y = "Count")

ggplot(titanic_data, aes(x = Class, fill = interaction(Survived, Sex))) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Survival on the Titanic by Class and Gender", x = "Passenger Class", y = "Count")

ggplot(titanic_data, aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution of Titanic Passengers", x = "Age", y = "Count")
