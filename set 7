1. Write a R program to create an array of two 3x3 matrices each with 3
rows and 3 columns from two given two vectors. Print the second row of
the second matrix of the array and theelement in the 3rd row and 3rd
column of the 1st matrix.

vector1 <- 1:9
vector2 <- 10:18

matrix1 <- matrix(vector1, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
matrix2 <- matrix(vector2, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)

array_of_matrices <- array(c(matrix1, matrix2), dim = c(3, 3, 2))

second_row_matrix2 <- array_of_matrices[2, , 2]
element_3rd_row_1st_matrix <- array_of_matrices[3, 3, 1]

print(second_row_matrix2)
print(element_3rd_row_1st_matrix)


2. Write a R program to create an array with three columns, three rows,
and two "tables",taking two vectors as input to the array. Print the
array


vector1 <- 1:6
vector2 <- 7:12

matrix1 <- matrix(vector1, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
matrix2 <- matrix(vector2, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)

array_of_tables <- array(c(matrix1, matrix2), dim = c(3, 3, 2))

print(array_of_tables)



3. Explore the airquality dataset. It contains daily air quality
measurements from New Yorkduring a period of five months:
• Ozone: mean ozone concentration (ppb),
• Solar.R: solar radiation (Langley),
• Wind: average wind speed (mph),
• Temp: maximum daily temperature in degrees Fahrenheit,
• Month: numeric month (May=5, June=6, and so on),
• Day: numeric day of the month (1- 31).
i. Compute the mean temperature(don’t use build in function)
ii. Extract the first five rows from airquality.
iii. Extract all columns from airquality except Temp and Wind
iv. Which was the coldest day during the period?
v. How many days was the wind speedgreater than 17 mph?




data("airquality")

temp_values <- airquality$Temp
sum_temp <- sum(temp_values, na.rm = TRUE)
count_temp <- sum(!is.na(temp_values))
mean_temp <- sum_temp / count_temp
print(mean_temp)

first_five_rows <- airquality[1:5, ]
print(first_five_rows)

airquality_without_temp_wind <- airquality[, !(names(airquality) %in% c("Temp", "Wind"))]
print(airquality_without_temp_wind)

coldest_temp <- min(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)
coldest_day <- airquality[airquality$Temp == coldest_temp, ]
print(coldest_day)

wind_days_greater_than_17 <- sum(airquality$Wind > 17, na.rm = TRUE)
print(wind_days_greater_than_17)




4. Write a R program to sort a given data frame by name and score.
exam_data <- data.frame(
  name = c('Anastasia', 'Dima', 'Katherine', 'James', 'Emily', 'Michael', 'Matthew', 'Laura', 'Kevin', 'Jonas'),
  score = c(12.5, 9, 16.5, 12, 9, 20, 14.5, 13.5, 8, 19)
)

sorted_data <- exam_data[order(exam_data$name, exam_data$score), ]
print(sorted_data)
