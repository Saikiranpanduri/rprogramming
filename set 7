1. Write a R program to create an array of two 3x3 matrices each with 3
rows and 3 columns from two given two vectors. Print the second row of
the second matrix of the array and theelement in the 3rd row and 3rd
column of the 1st matrix.

vector1 <- 1:9
vector2 <- 10:18

matrix1 <- matrix(vector1, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
matrix2 <- matrix(vector2, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)

array_of_matrices <- array(c(matrix1, matrix2), dim = c(3, 3, 2))

second_row_matrix2 <- array_of_matrices[2, , 2]
element_3rd_row_1st_matrix <- array_of_matrices[3, 3, 1]

print(second_row_matrix2)
print(element_3rd_row_1st_matrix)


2. Write a R program to create an array with three columns, three rows,
and two "tables",taking two vectors as input to the array. Print the
array


vector1 <- 1:6
vector2 <- 7:12

matrix1 <- matrix(vector1, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
matrix2 <- matrix(vector2, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)

array_of_tables <- array(c(matrix1, matrix2), dim = c(3, 3, 2))

print(array_of_tables)
