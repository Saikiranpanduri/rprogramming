1. factors


num <- 28
factors <- c()

for (i in 1:num) {
  if (num %% i == 0) {
    factors <- c(factors, i)
  }
}

print(factors)



2. Write a R program to create a list of random numbers in normal
distribution and countoccurrences of each value.
set.seed(123)

random_numbers <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
random_numbers <- round(random_numbers, 2)

occurrences <- table(random_numbers)

print(occurrences)


3. For this exercise, use the (built-in) dataset Titanic.
a. Draw a Bar chart to show details of “Survived” on the Titanic based on
passenger Class
b. Modify the above plot based on gender of people who survived
c. Draw histogram plot to show distribution of feature “Age”


library(ggplot2)

data("Titanic")
titanic_df <- as.data.frame(Titanic)

bar_plot_class <- ggplot(titanic_df, aes(x = Class, fill = factor(Survived))) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Survival on the Titanic by Passenger Class", x = "Passenger Class", fill = "Survived") +
  theme_minimal()
print(bar_plot_class)

bar_plot_gender <- ggplot(titanic_df, aes(x = Class, fill = interaction(Sex, Survived))) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Survival on the Titanic by Passenger Class and Gender", x = "Passenger Class", fill = "Gender and Survived") +
  theme_minimal()
print(bar_plot_gender)

histogram_age <- ggplot(titanic_df, aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution of Titanic Passengers", x = "Age", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
print(histogram_age)


4. Write a R program to combine three arrays so that the first row of the
first array is followedby the first row of the second array and then first
row of the third array


array1 <- array(1:6, dim = c(2, 3))
array2 <- array(7:12, dim = c(2, 3))
array3 <- array(13:18, dim = c(2, 3))

combined_array <- rbind(array1[1, ], array2[1, ], array3[1, ])
print(combined_array)
